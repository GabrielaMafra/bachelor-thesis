Specifying software provides safety guarantees for the system and
facilitates modifications and optimizations on the specified program, which is specially interesting for concurrent or distributed systems, where there are many behaviors to be considered. Specifications for this systems can be written in the specification language \TLA, which is composed by definitions close to mathematics and tools that allow verification of temporal logic described properties. This work proposes an automatic translator of \TLA specifications to the funcional and concurrent programming language Elixir, allowing the execution of the specified system.
